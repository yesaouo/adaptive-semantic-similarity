原文 (維基百科-自然語言處理)
自然語言處理是人工智慧和語言學領域的分支學科。此領域探討如何處理及運用自然語言；自然語言處理包括多方面和步驟，基本有認知、理解、生成等部分。
自然語言認知和理解是讓電腦把輸入的語言變成有意思的符號和關係，然後根據目的再處理。自然語言生成系統則是把計算機數據轉化為自然語言。
自然語言處理要研製表示語言能力和語言應用的模型, 建立計算框架來實現並完善語言模型，並根據語言模型設計各種實用系統及探討這些系統的評測技術。

Natural language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence and linguistics. This field explores how to process and use natural language; natural language processing includes many aspects and steps, basically including cognition, understanding, generation and other parts.
Natural language cognition and understanding is to let the computer turn the input language into interesting symbols and relationships, and then process it according to the purpose. The natural language generation system converts computer data into natural language.
Natural language processing requires the development of models that represent language abilities and language applications, the establishment of computing frameworks to implement and improve language models, the design of various practical systems based on language models, and the exploration of evaluation technologies for these systems.
